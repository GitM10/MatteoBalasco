## Overview

This project focuses on designing and deploying a high-performance, secure, and scalable network infrastructure. 
The architecture follows a layered design approach, ensuring redundancy, 
high availability, and optimal traffic flow for enterprise workloads.

A key design decision was to position the firewalls out-of-band rather than inline. Since the Palo Alto firewalls 220 are not 10 Gbps capable,
placing them inline would create a bottleneck for high-performance VLANs. To avoid this, the firewalls are connected externally with 
traffic dynamically redirected inbound and outbound based on routing policies for specific VLANs. This ensures:
- âœ… Unrestricted high-speed internal traffic for specific VLANs.
- âœ… Selective security enforcement based on traffic classification.
- âœ… Optimized network throughput while maintaining security controls.

## Key Features

1. **ISP & Routing Layer**
- ISP Uplink: 10G Down / 3G Up
- Router: Mikrotik CCR2116-12G-4S+
Core routing and traffic management are connected to firewalls and high-performance distribution switches.
It also manages inter-VLAN traffic and the stateful firewall, where every connection is checked before entering or leaving the network.

2. **Firewall Layer (Security Perimeter)**
- Active-Active Firewall Setup for fw01-panos-mi (Palo Alto) and fw02-panos-mi (Palo Alto)
Provides network segmentation, traffic filtering, and advanced security policies. Used only to filter traffic for specific VLANs

3. **Distribution Layer**
High-Performance Switching Backbone with Mikrotik CRS326-24S+2Q+RM
- Handles high-speed interconnects and backbone traffic distribution (HA). 

4. **Access Layer**
Ubiquiti Enterprise 48 PoE Switches are used as access ports for connected devices. They manage up to 2.5 Gbps per port
- Each Ubiquiti switch is connected to both distribution switches

5. **Controller Layer**
Ubiquiti Dream Machine (UDM)
Centralized network management for all UniFi/Ubiquiti devices in the network
- It is connected with a backup link to the router for high availability



6. **Logical Groups of Endpoints**
- Enterprise Panels & Biometric Systems
- Hypervisors, servers, and high-performance computing (HPC)
- Wi-Fi and Workstations


## Network Design & Redundancy
High-Availability & Failover Mechanisms
- âœ… Redundant Uplinks: ISP connection with failover support.
- âœ… Firewall High-Availability (HA): Active-Active Palo Alto setup.
- âœ… Dual Core Switching Fabric: High-speed qSPF+ links (HA)
- âœ… Multiple Edge Switches: Ensuring localized redundancy.
- âœ… Auto-Failover Routing: Intelligent traffic rerouting during failures.

Optimized Traffic Routing

ðŸš€ Inter-VLAN Routing: Efficient traffic segmentation.

ðŸš€ BGP Routing Strategies: Dynamic routing for scalability.

ðŸš€ Load Balancing: Traffic evenly distributed for high performance.


## Mermaid code for the Graph 
For everyone who doesnâ€™t know, Mermaid is a powerful, text-based diagramming tool that allows users to create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts,
and more using a simple markdown-like syntax. Itâ€™s especially useful for network engineers, developers, and IT professionals who need to visualize
complex architectures without using heavyweight design software.
In this project, Mermaid was used to represent the network architecture, illustrating the relationships between different layers, devices, and
connections in an easy-to-understand format.
By using Mermaid, we can generate dynamic and scalable diagrams directly from text, making it easier to update and maintain visual documentation.
- You can use the free Mermaid Live Editor available at [Mermaid.js Live Editor](https://mermaid.js.org/) to generate, modify, and preview diagrams in real time.

## Outcome
The deployment has improved network reliability, security, and scalability while reducing manual configuration overhead.

P.S. The project also included a WireGuard VPN site-to-site connection with another Mikrotik router, utilizing iBGP for route distribution
but thatâ€™s a story for another time
